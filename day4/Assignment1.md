# cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/TagCreator/
# sudo git remote add upstream https://github.com/lovedeepsh/jenkins-1.git
# sudo git fetch upstream

2. Create a Deployer Jenkins Job(static-code-deployment). 
3. It will checkout code from https://github.com//jenkins.git (your forked repo). 
4. Job will require a parameter TAG_NAME 
5. It will use SSH Publish plugin to publish files from jenkins server to target server 
6. Deploy index.html (existed inside attendees/assignments/day7) into nginx doc root.

8. Deploy with new tag. 
- Created new job “Deploy”
- Also installed Publish over ssh plugin
- Gave the string parameter for tag
- Provided the git repository in source code management
- Selected the post build option for “Send build artifacts over ssh”
- Go tot manage jenkins and configure system. At the end, provide the details for the ssh server.
